- Mustache.js
- Express.js
- Typescript

## Install and use
### Install

```

### Start a project
To start a new Bigo project with a default autogenerated application, `blank` or `landing`, run the following command:

```

This will generate an Express application with a Bigo skeleton in a diretory `\myName`.

The project created is a Typescript Express aplication, so there are multiple ways of running the application.

This will create the following files:
```
.
|- myComponent
|  |- myComponent.ts
|  |- myComponent.html
```
